## What is PhoneView for Mac?

PhoneView is a powerful Mac application that lets you access, view, and manage files on your iPhone or iPad directly from your computer. It acts as a bridge between your iOS device and macOS, offering a simple way to transfer photos, messages, music, notes, and more—without using iTunes or iCloud.

With PhoneView, you can browse your device’s content as if it were a USB drive. The app supports exporting SMS, iMessage, and WhatsApp conversations, saving voicemails, and copying music and videos to your Mac. It also allows you to use your iOS device as a portable storage drive.

PhoneView is fully compatible with all iPhone and iPad models and works with the latest versions of iOS and macOS. Whether you need to create backups, recover lost data, or simply free up space on your device, PhoneView provides a reliable and user-friendly solution.
